    <p>
    People often percieve me as a regular person, but that's their mistake 'cause I actually fail to understand the social rules of most situations. I just get lucky.
    It's ok though, I make up for it by being pretty cool and hot.

    I spend most of my time flipping between my various hobbies which means that I am reasonable at a lot of things but not super amazing at anything (except maybe my job...)
